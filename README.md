- 👋 Hi, I’m "John David" Bowman, a 76 year old life-long learner.  I'm currently working on a C# family scrapbook program (storing/retrieving family documents, images, videos, audio intereview, geneology, etc).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning C# better.  I've been working with and learning about C#, MVisualS and Git for about a year. I've worked through _HeadFirst_C#_ (Stellman & Greene) and _C#_Programming_ (McGrath) and now working through Mark Price's _C#_10_and_.Net6_.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use zip files to store images, videos, audio files, etc; accessing sql databse; using a collapsable index; Forms; and the like. 
- 💞️ In the future, I may be looking to collaborate on ... (Well, given so many things beyond the basics I've already had to use in my program, I'm sure something will come up, but for now I'm making progress.)
- 📫 How to reach me JohnDavidBowman@gmail.com.
